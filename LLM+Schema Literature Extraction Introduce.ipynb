    "# Literature Information Extraction using LLM + Json Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1 Background and Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "In scientific research, we often need to extract key information from numerous literatures, such as the synthesis methods of catalysts, active components, characterization results, etc. The traditional approach relies on manual reading and organization page by page, which is not only inefficient but also prone to omissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) has provided possibilities for automated or semi-automated information extraction. We can use LLMs to ask targeted questions about literature, allowing the model to extract key information from given literature abstracts or text fragments and output it in a structured format.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the output of LLM more controllable and verifiable, we can set a **Json Schema** in the prompt. This Schema specifies which fields the output should contain, field types, whether they are required, and other information. LLM will try to output content that conforms to the Json Schema format according to our specifications in the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Summary**  \n",
    "> - **LLM** can understand our questions and generate text, and can also output structured data according to our 'rules'.  \n",
    "> - **Json Schema** is used to constrain the structure of the output data, making subsequent data processing and analysis more convenient.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 2 Example of Literature Information Extraction for Acetylene Hydrogenation Catalysts\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an example specifically for 'Acetylene Hydrogenation Catalyst Literature Information Extraction', including **System Prompt** (system prompt to LLM) and **Json Schema** (used to define the output structure). When we input prompts in the LLM API or in the dialogue interface, we can combine these two parts or input them separately (some platforms support system prompts and user prompts in the API).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 System Prompt Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first look at the system prompt formulated for 'Acetylene Hydrogenation Catalyst Information Extraction'. This system prompt details how we should extract information and the format of the JSON object that needs to be output (field names, field meanings, etc.):\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Please use the following steps to extract information from the given literature on acetylene selective hydrogenation catalysts:\n",
    "0. Collect basic information of this literature, including title, year, publication, list of authors (only corresponding authors) and their address.\n",
    "1. Analyze whether the literature involves information on the synthesis, characterization, and evaluation of acetylene selective hydrogenation catalysts.\n",
    "2. If it does, identify all relevant information on catalyst synthesis and evaluation.\n",
    "3. Extract the following parameters:\n",
    "   - Synthesis Method: Includes specific steps of catalyst synthesis (e.g., co-precipitation, sol-gel method, heat treatment, etc.) and heat treatment conditions (temperature, time, etc.).\n",
    "   - Active Components and Promoters: Includes metal elements and their content.\n",
    "   - Support Type: Type of support material and surface modification method.\n",
    "   - Catalyst Structural Characteristics: Descriptions such as nanoparticles, single-atom sites, dual-atom sites, etc.\n",
    "   - Heat Treatment Conditions: Temperature, time, atmosphere, etc.\n",
    "   - Reaction Conditions: Acetylene concentration, temperature, pressure, etc.\n",
    "   - Catalyst Activity, Selectivity, Stability: Activity (acetylene conversion), selectivity (ethylene selectivity), and stability (catalyst stability over time).\n",
    "4. Organize the extracted information into a structured JSON format that complies with the given JSON Schema. Only report this json object.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Json Schema Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a Json Schema example corresponding to the System Prompt above, which defines the information fields to be extracted from the literature and their types, required attributes, etc. LLM should strictly adhere to these field specifications when outputting."

    "\n",
    "The above example is suitable for the 'acetylene hydrogenation' field. If students in the research group want to apply the same idea to other fields (such as 'formic acid decomposition catalyst research'), they can let large language models assist in generating a preliminary Json Schema, and then manually modify and improve it. For example, we can ask the model the following question (Prompt):\n",

    "I am researching formic acid decomposition catalysts and want to extract the following information: the title of the literature, authors, formic acid decomposition reaction conditions (including temperature, pH value, solvent type), catalyst synthesis method, activity evaluation (such as hydrogen production rate), and characterization methods. Please help provide a suitable Json Schema based on these requirements, specifying field types and required attributes.\n",
